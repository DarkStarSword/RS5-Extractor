These objects each contain a (presumably) 2-plane image imposter of the model for when it is seen from far away. Each contains a `HEAD` chunk containing presumably the parameters of the 2-plane imposter, and a `DATA` chunk containing the texture with what appears to be a normal map. Each object typically has a `.i` extension for imposter.
