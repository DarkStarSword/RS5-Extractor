The RS5-Extractor program is designed to extract textures and models from a RS5 file.

Note that it currently does not export the contents of the `HEAD`, `TAGS` or `BBH ` chunks of the `IMDL` models.

It uses what I have garnered from digging into the [IonFx RS5 file format](wiki/IonFx Miasmata RS5 file format) from the `main.rs5` file included with Miasmata.
